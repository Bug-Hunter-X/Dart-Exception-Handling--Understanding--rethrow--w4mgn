# Dart Exception Handling: Understanding `rethrow`

This repository demonstrates a subtle point in Dart's exception handling concerning the `rethrow` keyword.  The `bug.dart` file showcases code that handles exceptions, but the exception handling could be improved.  The solution, in `bugSolution.dart`, addresses this.  The goal is to illustrate best practices for exception handling and when and how to rethrow exceptions effectively.

## Problem
The included `bug.dart` code attempts to gracefully handle exceptions from an asynchronous operation. The `rethrow` statement is used to propagate the exception upward. However, it's important to understand the impact of this choice.

## Solution
The improved code in `bugSolution.dart` shows the correct usage of rethrow in the context. 

## Learning Outcomes
By examining the provided code and its solution, you will gain a deeper understanding of:
- Dart's exception handling mechanisms.
- The proper use of the `try-catch-finally` block.
- When and how to use `rethrow` effectively.
